Bug List

1)Queue as a whole does not work how it is supposed to, it works in the way first in, last out instead of first in, first out.
  There is two reasons why this could happen:
  a)Either enqueue does not work properly and it enqueues the last element to be at the front of the list instead of the opposite or,
  b)Dequeue and Peak Front are not working as intendent. Assuming enqueue works fine, peak front shows the last element of the list while dequeue also
    removes the last element of the list instead of the first one in both dequeue and peak front.
Both problems are possible and, with the methods I have access to, I am not able to know which one is the faulty one because both theories create the
exact same situation. I attached a picture that explains a little more about the problem.

2)The destructor does not work. When I create a heap allocated Queue and call to delete, Valgrid shows that there are still some things in heap, that
means that the destructor is not working properly and not deleting the necessary things.

3)Dequeue "return" is wrong in the comments. I am pretty sure it was a typo, but line 43 of the Queue class says that it returns the first item of the queue,
but obviously, this is not true because the function is a void and does not return anything. I just wanted to list this in case it is considered a bug even if it
does not affect the actual code but affects the expectations of the people who read the code.
